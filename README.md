# Spam Email Detection Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying emails as spam or non-spam using text classification techniques. The model helps users filter out unwanted and potentially harmful emails.

## Project Structure

- **dataset/**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **main.ipynb**: The primary Jupyter Notebook file where the model is developed and evaluated.
- **models/**: Stores trained models and vectorizers.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the necessary Python libraries and their versions.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather a dataset of both spam and non-spam emails.
   - Ensure the dataset is diverse and representative.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and prepare the data by removing noise, handling missing values, and converting text to a suitable format for machine learning.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract relevant features from the email text, such as word frequency, n-grams, or TF-IDF.

4. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest) for text classification.
   - Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Consider techniques like cross-validation to assess model generalization.

6. **Deployment (Optional)**:
   - Deploy the trained model as a web application or integrate it into an email client to filter incoming emails.
