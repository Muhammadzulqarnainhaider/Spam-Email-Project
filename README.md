Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying emails as spam or non-spam. By leveraging text classification techniques, the model can help users filter out unwanted and potentially harmful emails.

Project Structure

dataset/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
main.ipynb: The primary Jupyter Notebook file where the model is developed and evaluated.
models/: Stores trained models and vectorizers.
requirements.txt: Lists the necessary Python libraries and their versions.
Project Workflow

Data Collection:

Gather a dataset of both spam and non-spam emails.
Ensure the dataset is diverse and representative.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and prepare the data by removing noise, handling missing values, and converting text to a suitable format for machine learning.
Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features from the email text, such as word frequency, n-grams, or TF-IDF.
Model Selection and Training:

Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest) for text classification.
Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Consider techniques like cross-validation to assess model generalization.
Deployment (Optional):

Deploy the trained model as a web application or integrate it into an email client to filter incoming emails.
